Hi, I'm Eryn! I currently work as a Systems Engineer at [Uplift Games](https://uplift.games). I work on a lot of different things, including developer tooling, our websites, and adding systems into *Adopt Me*, our main game with over 60M monthly active users!

I'm a self-taught engineer with a passion for learning new things. I love going down the rabbit hole of learning the ins and outs of something that's new and exciting, and taking that experience with me onto the next thing. I also love teaching and helping other engineers with any problems they might have!

I've created or contributed to hundreds of projects using a wide breadth of technologies and patterns that I've learned along the way. I've worked on games (in Roblox and other engines), websites (both front end and back end), bots & automation, command line tools, add-ons & mods for various games, and all sorts of miscellaneous adventures. I believe that the best results can be achieved when you take experience and wisdom from many different places into account when creating something new.
